Here i am going to note how to find the number of perfect squares between any of two numbers

for Example
  if a=9 and b=25
     between them 9,16,25 are the 3 perfect square numbers
   how to find this
   
   by applying this formulae
     
      floor(sqrt(b))-ceil(sqrt(a))+1;
      
    in JAVA
      
      Math.floor(Math.sqrt(b))-Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(a))+1 ;
